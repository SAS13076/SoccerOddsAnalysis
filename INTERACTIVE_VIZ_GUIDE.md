# Viewing Interactive Visualizations

To fully experience the interactive visualizations in the Jupyter Notebook (`OddsEdgeAnalysis.ipynb`), follow these steps:

1. **Using Jupyter Locally**: 
   - Clone the repository to your local machine.
   - Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab installed.
   - Navigate to the directory containing the notebook and run `jupyter notebook` or `jupyter lab`.
   - Open `OddsEdgeAnalysis.ipynb` from the Jupyter interface.

2. **Using NBViewer**:
   - Go to [NBViewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).
   - Paste the GitHub URL of the notebook into the input box and click "Go!"
   - This will render the notebook with all visualizations.

3. **Binder**:
   - [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) can transform the notebook into an interactive environment. However, this requires additional setup. If the repository owner has set this up, you can just click on the Binder badge in the `README.md`.

For the best experience, viewing the notebook locally is recommended.
